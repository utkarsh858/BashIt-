A sublime text plugin for executing custom bash commands while editing.
Functionality for adding custom commands have not been integrated yet.
Currently features Git commands:
<ul>
<li>Add</li>
<li>commit</li>
<li>remote add</li>
<li>init</li>
<li>push  (works only if keys added to the remote repo)</li>
<li>pull</li>

<li>checkout -b</li></ul>

Package Installation Directory: <b>~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/</b>
Use it under <b>Tools > BashIt!</b>
Note the key board shortcuts <b>(m+alt+ )</b>, It'll come in handy.
Remember that it works only for opened folders which are in general used in conjugation with Git for remote repos.
